description
As we mentioned in the introduction. The game is based on two players who have to enter their names before the game itself.

The first player gets the letter X while the second gets the letter O.

The goal is for one of the mentioned players to have three fields filled with their sign

Victory is achieved if one of the players fills the above fields diagonally, across, or down.
In the event that all fields are filled without a winner, the result is a DRAW

The winner is announced with a message in the modal.


we also have three buttons,
The first is a new game that allows the fields to be agreed at the beginning, while the results remain saved in the header and list.
The second button is reset, which resets the entire game to the beginning.
The third button is List, where we can see the history of previous games
