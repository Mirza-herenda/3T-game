## Introduction

TIC TAC TOE is a game well known to younger and older people. Two players participate, one is X, the other is 0. The winner is the one who has three fields with their sign (diagonal, row, or across).

## Description

At the beginning, the user chooses which mode to play:

### First mode:

The user needs to enter their name and choose which level of difficulty they want to play.
If they choose "easy," the PC randomly fills in the fields with "O."
If they choose "medium," the PC selects the fields that are still empty in the user's row.
If they choose "hard," the PC selects the fields that are still empty in its own rows.

### Second mode:

The user enters their name, and the opponent is another user who also enters their name. This mode is based on the regular way of playing, where the winner is the first to have the same symbol in a diagonal, row, or column

Below the 3x3 grid, there are two buttons:

### History button:

which displays the history of previous rounds.

### Reset button:

which allows the user to undo their last move
